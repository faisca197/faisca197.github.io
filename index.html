      <h1>Porcshe GT3 RS</h1>
      <p>As if the GT3 was not impressive enough, the 2018 Porsche GT3 RS specs manage to exceed those of its predecessor. A purely performance-focused model, this mighty Porsche seems to defy the laws of physics. Designed specifically for track-use, an epic Nuringburg track finish time of 6:56.4 still manages to shock race car enthusiasts around the world. To achieve this feat, Porsche designers maintained all of the best aspects of the former GT3, but modified areas such as the engine and homed in on reducing drag with aerodynamic components. It is the ultimate example of the Porsche 991.2 chassis, with more downforce than any previous GT3.

Driving a new Porsche 911 GT3 RS is not for the faint of heart. The uninitiated will call the suspension stiff, and they will be in search of flat pavement. The 2-stage coil springs and ball-joint connections offer no compliance or apologies. The steering wheel responds with the precision of a scalpel, one that is stronger than your arms can support. Still, these are features and aspects that drivers look for in a performance sports car, supercar, or even race car. Simply put, the 911 GT3 is a perfect vehicle for those looking to test their limits as a driver and experience the true power of Porsche.</p>
