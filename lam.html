      <h1>Lamborghini Urus</h1>
      <p>On paper, the supercar-bred, 641-hp Lamborghini Urus sounds overmatched against the 707-hp, Hellcat-powered Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk. However, only one of these outrageous machines owns the crown as the quickest SUV we've ever run at Virginia International Raceway in our annual Lightning Lap event. For those who couldn’t guess, it's the Lambo, which costs nearly a quarter-million dollars. That's the entry price to own a wildly styled SUV of this pedigree. Along with unbelievable track skills for its size, the Urus offers some things that the Lamborghini Aventador and Huracán don't: a back seat, useable cargo space, and the ability to tow. While its interior craftsmanship isn't as good as its supercar siblings’, and it's the very definition of a gas-guzzler, the 2022 Lamborghini Urus is easily the most badass family hauler on the planet.

        The Urus is powered by a twin-turbo V-8 that makes a stout 641 horsepower, burbles deeply when idling, and absolutely howls under full throttle. Permanent all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission conspire with all that power to enable fantastic acceleration. In our testing, the Urus went from rocketed to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds and tore up the quarter-mile in 11.3 seconds at 121 mph. Likewise, Lamborghini estimates a top speed of 190 mph. The Urus feels athletic from behind the wheel, too, with quick steering and stable high-speed cornering. With air springs at all four corners, the Urus has adjustable ride heights based on its various drive modes. Standard carbon-ceramic brakes ensure that the Urus stops as well as it goes—braking from 70 mph to a stop in 149 feet.
