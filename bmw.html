      <h1>BMW M3 Competicion</h1>
      <p>The M3 is a legend in the world of performance cars, causing enthusiasts to gush over its visceral engines and razor-sharp handling. That legend, by the way, started all the way back in 1986 when the first M3—a performance edition of the similarly beloved E30 3-series—hit the scene. Despite the fact that the first one was offered only as a coupe, today's M3 comes only as a sedan; coupe and convertibles now wear the M4 badge.
<br>
<br>     
        Performance is similar to that of the M4 CS, with 62mph reached from rest in a dizzying 3.9sec (compared with 4.3sec for the standard M3), helped by sticky Michelin Pilot Cup 2 tyres. Ordinarily the M3 is limited to 155mph, but the CS has the electronic buffers removed as standard, for a top speed of 173mph.
<br>
<br>
The suspension set-up is firmer than the standard car, and the adaptive dampers have been recalibrated to suit the characteristics of the tyres.
